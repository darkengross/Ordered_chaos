        BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the
        Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band that was formed in 2010 and
        debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.[5] The septet—consisting of
        members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and
        co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop group, their
        musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their
        lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the
        themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and coming of age,
        loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work
        also often references literature and psychological concepts and includes
        an alternative universe storyline. After debuting in 2013 with their
        single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS released their first Korean-language
        studio album, Dark & Wild, and Japanese-language studio album, Wake Up,
        in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album, Wings (2016), was their
        first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed
        into the global music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United
        States and breaking numerous sales records. They became the first Korean
        group to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association
        of America (RIAA) for their single "Mic Drop", as well as the first
        Korean act to top the US Billboard 200 with their studio album Love
        Yourself: Tear (2018). BTS became one of the few groups since the
        Beatles to have four US number-one albums in less than two years, and
        Love Yourself: Answer (2018) was the first Korean album certified
        platinum by the RIAA. In 2020, BTS became the first all-South Korean act
        to reach number one on the Billboard Global 200 and US Billboard Hot 100
        with their Grammy-nominated single "Dynamite". Their follow-up releases
        "Savage Love", "Life Goes On", "Butter", and "Permission to Dance" made
        BTS the act quickest to have five US number-one singles since Michael
        Jackson.
